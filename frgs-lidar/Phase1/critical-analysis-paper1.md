# Critical Analysis: Tan & Rahman (2021) - Drone-based LiDAR for Forest Carbon Estimation in Southeast Asia

**Study Type:** Observational/quantitative (validation study). Follows STROBE guidelines partially.

**Summary:** Tests UAV-LiDAR for biomass/carbon in Malaysian forests (n=50 plots). Key claim: 15% error reduction vs. traditional; supports carbon credits.

**Bias/Validity (CASP/STROBE Adapted):**
- Selection: High risk—convenience sites; no randomization (underrepresents diverse ecosystems).
- Performance/Detection: Low—automated LiDAR; good calibration.
- Attrition: Low—no data loss.
- Reporting: Medium—positives emphasized; limitations (haze penetration) noted but not analyzed.
- Conflicts: Low—government funding transparent.
- Internal Validity: High (validated models, CIs provided).
- External: Medium—SE Asia specific, but small sample limits generalizability to Peninsular haze areas.

**Methodological Flaws:** No power analysis; lacks AI integration (manual processing); no multi-sensor fusion. Reproducibility: Software mentioned but no code.

**Logic Issues:** Overclaims scalability without cost analysis; ignores confounders (soil carbon). Balanced discussion but gaps in ethics (indigenous land access).

**Overall Quality:** Medium (R²=0.85 strong, but biases reduce reliability). Score: 0.7/1. Gaps for project: No real-time/haze correction.
