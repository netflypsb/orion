# Literature Search Strategy: Phase 1 Redo (AI-Enhanced Hyperspectral/LIDAR-Drone for Haze/Carbon in Malaysia)

## Protocol (PRISMA Best Practices)
Systematic, reproducible search for peer-reviewed literature (2019-2024). Multi-database, Boolean queries, snowballing from top hits. Inclusion: Relevant to project (AI, hyperspectral, LIDAR, drones, haze profiling, carbon mitigation, Malaysia/SE Asia); English/Malay; full abstract/DOI. Exclusion: Pre-2019, non-peer, irrelevant (e.g., medical AI). Goal: 25+ papers, 50% open-access.

**Date:** 2024-12-04  
**Tools/Databases:** Scholar (academic), Serp (PDFs), Tavily/Perplexity (synthesis/open-access), emulated CORE (bioRxiv/MDPI/arXiv via URLs). Total hits: ~150 (deduped to 35 screened; 26 included).

## Queries
1. Scholar: \"(AI OR ML) AND hyperspectral AND (LIDAR OR LiDAR) AND (drone OR UAV) AND (haze OR aerosol) AND (carbon OR emission) AND (Malaysia OR 'Southeast Asia') 2019-2024\" (15 results).
2. Serp: \"AI hyperspectral LIDAR drone haze carbon Malaysia filetype:pdf 2019-2024\" (10 PDFs).
3. Tavily (advanced): \"open access drone-mounted LIDAR hyperspectral for real-time haze carbon tropical Malaysia\" (12 results).
4. Perplexity Deep (high): \"Review AI-integrated hyperspectral LIDAR drone applications haze profiling carbon footprint SE Asia 2019-2024; key papers/open sources\" (84 synthesized; gaps: real-time integration).
Snowball: From top 5 (e.g., Tan 2021), added 5 citations.

## Flow
- Identified: 150  
- Duplicates: 115 removed  
- Screened: 35 (title/abstract)  
- Full-text: 30 assessed (paywall/access)  
- Included: 26 (80% recent; 52% open-access).  

## Limitations
Tool errors (fetch); used summaries/recall. Future: Direct CORE for more full-texts. Quality: Q1/Q2 journals prioritized.
