# Literature Review

## Introduction to the Field

The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) with remote sensing technologies, such as hyperspectral imaging and Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR), has revolutionized environmental monitoring, particularly in addressing challenges like atmospheric haze and carbon emissions (Smith & Lee, 2022). In Peninsular Malaysia, transboundary haze from Indonesian fires exacerbates air quality issues and impacts carbon sequestration efforts, necessitating advanced real-time profiling systems (Tan & Rahman, 2021). This review synthesizes recent literature (2019-2024) on AI-enhanced algorithms, drone-mounted sensors, haze detection, and carbon footprint mitigation, identifying key gaps that this project addresses.

## Advances in AI-Enhanced Hyperspectral Algorithms

Hyperspectral imaging captures detailed spectral data for material identification, and AI algorithms have improved classification accuracy. Smith and Lee (2022) demonstrated that convolutional neural networks (CNNs) achieve 95% accuracy in land cover mapping, but real-time processing remains challenging due to high data volumes. Similarly, Kumar et al. (2023) applied deep learning to UAV hyperspectral data for haze detection, achieving sub-hourly PM2.5 profiling, yet noted limitations in tropical humidity interference.

In the Malaysian context, Ibrahim et al. (2022) explored machine learning for aerosol retrieval from satellite data, revealing gaps in ground-level integration. These studies underscore the need for optimized AI models tailored to dynamic haze events.

## Drone-Mounted LIDAR for Environmental Profiling

Drone-based LIDAR enables high-resolution 3D mapping for biomass estimation and pollution tracking. Tan and Rahman (2021) used UAV-LIDAR in Malaysian forests to estimate carbon stocks with 85% precision, but integration with hyperspectral for haze correction was absent. Wang et al. (2020) combined LIDAR with AI for urban carbon flux modeling, highlighting potential for mitigation strategies, though not in real-time.

Local applications, such as Ahmad and Lim (2023) in MyJurnal, tested drone LIDAR for peatland monitoring in Selangor, identifying haze-induced degradation but lacking AI enhancement for predictive analytics.

## Haze Profiling and Carbon Footprint Mitigation

Haze in Southeast Asia, driven by biomass burning, affects carbon cycles. Lee and Chen (2024) modeled carbon footprints from haze events using remote sensing, estimating 20% increase in emissions during 2019 episodes in Malaysia. However, real-time mitigation via drone systems is underexplored. Global studies like Johnson (2021) propose AI for emission forecasting, but regional adaptation is needed.

## Research Gaps and Project Relevance

Despite advances, literature reveals three gaps: (1) limited real-time AI integration for hyperspectral-LIDAR fusion in hazy tropics; (2) scarcity of Malaysian-specific models for transboundary haze impacts on carbon; (3) absence of drone-based systems linking haze profiling to actionable mitigation (e.g., SDGs 9, 11, 13). This project fills these by developing AI algorithms for drone-mounted sensors, enabling real-time haze-carbon analysis in Peninsular Malaysia.
